## Algorithms
1. Dijkstra's
2. Breadth First Search
3. Greedy Breadth First Search
4. Depth First Search
5. Bi-directional BFS
6. A* Search

 ## Tech Stack
 1. React JS
 2. Bootstrap

## How it works
1. User can drag around a start and end node and set them in any place.
2. User can draw walls by clicking and dragging the mouse pointer.
3. User can customize the grid, experiment with different obstacles, and observe how these changes affect the pathfinding process.
4. User can add weights to blocks and can randomize the weights.
5. User can then choose a speed of the visualization.
6. This tool visualizes the algorithm and finds the shortest path between start and end nodes.
